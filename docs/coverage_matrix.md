# FaceX coverage matrix

What's compiled, what's syntax-checked, what's actually run end-to-end,
per (target × backend × build flag) combo. This document is filled from
`scripts/test_all.sh` output, not aspiration.

Each topic commit (Bench / Mac / i.MX / ESP32) appends its own rows.

## Legend

- ✅ **passing** — verified by `scripts/test_all.sh` on the noted host
- 🧪 **compile-only** — syntax-checked / linker-resolved against stub or vendor headers; not executed
- 🛠 **stub** — code path exists and compiles, but real backend or model is not implemented
- 🚫 **blocked** — needs hardware / SDK we don't have here
- — — does not apply

## Verification host

| Host | Hardware | Compiler |
|---|---|---|
| **mac-m2** | Apple M2, macOS 26 | Apple Clang 21 (Xcode 16+) |
| upstream | (assumed) | (varied) |

## CPU library (`libfacex.a`)

| Target / build flag | Compiles | Static analysis | Smoke test | E2E test | Tested on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `make` — host arch (Apple Silicon arm64, NEON) | ✅ | ✅ `otool -L` shows libSystem only | ✅ `golden_test`: `||emb||²=0.076`, sim=1.000 | ✅ via `facex-bench`: ~4.6 ms/embed median, ~8.4 ms e2e | mac-m2 | Default Mac build (Bench foundation) |
| `make` — host arch (x86-64 + AVX2) | 🧪 (upstream) | upstream | upstream `golden_test` | upstream | — | Pre-existing path, untouched |
| `make` — host arch (x86-64 + AVX-512 + VNNI) | 🧪 (upstream) | upstream | upstream | upstream | — | Auto-detected via `-mavx512f -dM` probe |
| `make` — Linux aarch64 (NEON) | 🧪 (Makefile path exists) | n/a | — | — | — | Same C as mac-m2; no Linux ARM box here |
| WASM (Emscripten) | 🧪 (upstream) | upstream | upstream demo | upstream demo | — | `wasm/` artifacts pre-existed |

## Bench infrastructure

| Tool | Compiles / runs | Tested | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `facex-bench` (cross-platform engine bench) | ✅ | ✅ md + csv + json output; embed and e2e stages | One source / one schema across all build flavours |
| `facex-camera-bench` (release, AVFoundation) | ✅ | ✅ — 29.0 fps, detect+embed med ~5 ms | Mac-only; lives in this commit but exercises the camera pipeline |
| `facex-camera-bench` (debug / profile) | ✅ | 🧪 builds; not benchmarked | LLDB / Instruments variants |
| `facex-camera-bench --summary` | ✅ | ✅ emits one CSV row at exit (schema matches `facex-bench`) | Lets camera and engine numbers join in one table |
| `scripts/bench_all.sh` (build-flag sweep) | ✅ | ✅ produces unified Markdown table comparing default config on M2 | Run before/after a perf change to spot regressions |
| `scripts/test_all.sh` (full local test runner) | ✅ | ✅ all checks runnable on mac-m2 pass | Topic commits amend with their own checks |

## Pre-existing tooling

| Tool | Compiles / runs | Tested | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bash download_weights.sh` | ✅ | ✅ produces `data/edgeface_xs_fp32.bin` | One-time fetch from GitHub release |
| `tools/export_yunet_weights.py` | ✅ (needs `onnx`+`numpy`) | ✅ produces `weights/yunet_fp32.bin` | Pre-existing |
| `facex-cli` | ✅ | ✅ via `make test` | stdin/stdout subprocess engine |
| `golden-test` | ✅ | ✅ — `||emb||²=0.076`, self-sim 1.000 | Cross-platform smoke |

## Test runner

`scripts/test_all.sh` runs everything in this matrix that's runnable on the
current host. Latest result on **mac-m2** at the Bench commit:

```
host:     Darwin / arm64
compiler: Apple clang version 21.0.0
ALL OK
```

The runner exits non-zero on first failure and prints the offending
command's output (first 20 lines), so CI can wire it directly.

## What's NOT covered (and why)

| Configuration | Why uncovered | Path to coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Apple-specific perf paths (Accelerate / SME / Core ML) | Added in Mac commit | See `docs/mac.md` once it lands |
| i.MX 93 / 95 / 8M Plus boards | NPU library lives in i.MX commit | See `docs/imx_npu.md` once it lands |
| ESP32-P4 dev kit | Component lives in ESP32 commit | See `docs/esp32p4.md` once it lands |
| Linux aarch64 server | No host available | Run `scripts/test_all.sh` on a Graviton / Ampere instance |
| Linux x86-64 with AVX-512+VNNI | No host with VNNI here | Same |

## Reading guide for maintainers

- "✅ tested on mac-m2" rows are real, current-tip. Reproduce with
  `scripts/test_all.sh`.
- "🧪 compile-only" rows are honest about *what* was checked and *what
  wasn't*. Don't promote to "✅" without an end-to-end run.
- "🚫 blocked" rows have a clear unblock path in the rightmost column.
- Topic commits (Mac, i.MX, ESP32) **append** new rows here — diff this
  file when shipping new platform support.
